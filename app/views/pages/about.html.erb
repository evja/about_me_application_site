  <h2> A little about me and why I will be a great software engineer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li id="lego">I grew up playing Legos</li>

        from such a young age, the building and creating gadgets and contraptions with Legos was always my passion.
        Many saturdays, from morning till night, with back aching and wrists hurtng from
        sorting through the mountains of legos, I would construct my dreams. it cultivated in me creativity, imagination and joy for creating.
        I am a creator, a very small one, but still a creator.

          So i'm a curious person, always wondering, always asking questions and seeking answers saying "what if.."
          then giving it at try. it's been said that "an expert is someone who has made all the mistakes one can make in a narrow feild"
          i suppose to become an expert you must be curious where the boundaries are and then push to them.
          when you're curious you try, you fall and try again.
        </p>
    </ul>

      I learn very fast and respect those around me, I love that there are so many people that know much
      more than me, because that means that I have so much to lean and grow, and i never want to stop learning.
      That is one of the most intriguing things about programming and software, the creations seem limitless.

      As an aspiring software engineer I know i will excell at whatever environment i put myself into.
      I am dedicated, hard working and focused. I grew up on a farm and have worked for everything i have.
      some things are harder than others but learning by immersion is where the magic happens. sure it's scary and
      you wonder if it will crush you, but things usually are worse in your imaination than in real life.
      Through my life i have found that when presented with a problem/challenge, and you overcome it..
      it really never is as bad as you would have imagined it to be. and then you have that experience to
      reenforce your resolve for the next time a challenge comes.
      as Mark Twain once said,
      "I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened."
